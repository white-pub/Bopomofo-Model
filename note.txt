Dataset

Computer font:

  I used the 14 free fonts listed on this website(【2024】14 款免費注音字體下載－可商用 無版權問題 https://sidonie.ca/9-free-bopomofo-fonts/)

  Aside from being free, users can also use these fonts for commercial. See more info on the website.

Handwritten characters:

  By me, my brother, and my friends. We all learned to write the bopomofo characters from a young age, but used it less often after we graduated elementray school, as is common in Taiwan.

use 28x28 pixels for each character

characterNum_fontNum_fontNote.png
otherInfo example: bold, italic, regular...
"A" in otherInfo just means its is the only font face and does not have any special note.
Ex: 01_15_A.png would be for character 01 (ㄅ) from font 15.

documentation draft:

I tested the model ("session_id": 32, "timestamp": "2024-12-12T00:14:09") with various datasets.
I found that the model performed better on computer fonts then on hand written characters. But if i only put my hand written character in, it get around the same accuracy as on computer font, which is about 84%. 
For the prediction mentioned above, my characters are in a very different ordered then in the training set for the model. 
Further experiment showed that when the testing set have the same character order as the training set, the accuracy is improved by 10%. Hand writing characters by the same person(Jacob) changed form 65% accuracy to 74% accuracy. Computer font (17 ToneOZ-Zhuyin-Tsuipita-TC) changed form 85% to 95% accuracy.
I think the model might have memorized the position a character is in the picture instead of just the shape of the character. So i am going to work on updating the training datasets with different order and use cross-validation to improve its performance in generalization.


I found that i can generate each character in its own image with python, which is much faster and provide me more options to adjust the image. Originally i thought to use offset = [(0, 0), (-5, 0), (5, 0), (0, -5), (0, 5)] to ensure there in a centered image and a few off-centered image, then I decide to use random number for the position of the off-centered position to provide more variety.

To make the training dataset more balanced, and add in the different font weights, i grouped the fonts into four types: even strokes, dynamic strokes, heavily stylized, and handwritten fonts. 

dynamic stroke fonts - 7 fonts 
- 29 font files in total(some font have up to six font weight)
BpmfGenRyuMin-R.ttf
BpmfGenWanMin-R.ttf
BpmfGenYoMin-R.ttf
BpmfIansui-Regular.ttf
BpmfZihiKaiStd-Regular.ttf
BpmfZihiOnly-R.ttf
BpmfZihiSerif-Regular.ttf

even stroke fonts - 4 fonts
- 24 font files in total(some font have up to six font weight)
BpmfGenSekiGothic-R.ttf
BpmfGenSenRounded-R.ttf
BpmfGenYoGothic-R.ttf
BpmfZihiSans-Regular.ttf

heavily stylized fonts - 2 fonts
12_elffont-rock.otf
13_elffont-fern.otf

handwritten fonts - 2 fonts
