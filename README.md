# Bopomofo Recognition Model
This project aims to build a machine-learning model to recognize individual Bopomofo characters. The project will involve several key stages:

1. Data Collection: Gathering a dataset that includes handwritten characters from myself and my family and at least a dozen different computer fonts of Bopomofo characters.
2. Data Cleaning and Processing: To ensure accuracy and consistency, prepare the collected data for training by cleaning and processing it.
3. Model Training: Training the model on the cleaned dataset to recognize individual characters.
4. Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the trained model to ensure it accurately identifies Bopomofo characters.
5. Future Improvements: Exploring further training to enhance the model's ability to recognize characters in proper groups.

The goal is to create a reliable recognition model that can help people understand a sentence or phrase even when Bopomofo phonetic is included.
